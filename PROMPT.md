# Ralph Agent Instructions

## Project Context
Building a Fantasy League History Tracker that unifies data from Yahoo Fantasy and Sleeper into one place with rich statistics and an eye-catching UI.

## Your Task

1. Read `scripts/ralph/prd.json` for the task list
2. Read `scripts/ralph/progress.txt` for learnings and patterns
3. Ensure you're on the correct branch (`ralph/fantasy-league-history`)
4. Pick the highest priority story where `passes: false`
5. Implement that ONE story completely
6. Verify the acceptance criteria are met
7. Commit with message: `feat: [ID] - [Title]`
8. Update prd.json: set `passes: true` for completed story
9. Append learnings to progress.txt

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python with FastAPI
- Frontend: React with Vite and Tailwind CSS
- Database: SQLite with SQLAlchemy
- Charts: Recharts for visualizations

## Progress Format

APPEND to progress.txt after each story:
```
## [Date] - [Story ID]
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered
  - Gotchas encountered
```

## Stop Condition

If ALL stories have `passes: true`, reply with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

Otherwise, end normally after completing one story.
