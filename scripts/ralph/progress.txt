# Fantasy League History Tracker - Ralph Progress Log (Improvements v2)
Started: 2026-01-07

## Codebase Patterns
- Backend: FastAPI with uvicorn at http://localhost:8000
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS at http://localhost:5173
- Database: SQLite with SQLAlchemy
- CORS configured to allow frontend dev server

## Key Files
- backend/app/main.py - FastAPI application entry point
- backend/app/api/routes.py - API route definitions
- backend/app/services/sleeper_client.py - Sleeper API client
- backend/app/services/sleeper_service.py - Sleeper import service
- frontend/src/App.tsx - Main React component
- frontend/src/index.css - Tailwind CSS imports

## Issues Being Addressed
1. Sleeper Import - Missing Historical Seasons (only imports current season)
2. Sleeper Import - No Champion Detection (playoff winner not recorded)
3. Sleeper Import - Player IDs Not Resolved (trades show numbers not names)
4. Yahoo Fantasy Import - Not fully implemented
5. UI/UX Gaps - Import modal needs loading states and error handling

## 2025-01-10 - IMP-001
- What was implemented: Added methods to traverse Sleeper league history chain via previous_league_id
- Files changed:
  - `backend/app/services/sleeper_client.py` - Added get_previous_league_id() and get_league_history_chain() methods
  - `backend/tests/test_sleeper.py` - Added 4 new tests for chain traversal
- **Learnings:**
  - Sleeper API returns previous_league_id in league data which links to the same league from prior seasons
  - Chain traversal allows finding all historical league IDs from a single current league ID
  - Tests: 28 sleeper tests now passing (was 24, added 4)

## 2025-01-10 - IMP-002
- What was implemented: Full historical season import functionality for Sleeper leagues
- Files changed:
  - `backend/app/services/sleeper_service.py` - Modified import_full_league() and related methods
  - `backend/tests/test_sleeper.py` - Added 4 new tests for multi-season import and idempotency
- **Learnings:**
  - Each Sleeper season has a unique league_id, but they should all link to ONE League record in DB
  - Added optional `league` parameter to import methods to pass the shared League record through
  - Idempotency works because existing code checks for duplicate records before creating new ones
  - import_single_season() helper keeps import_full_league() cleaner
  - Tests: 31 sleeper tests now passing (was 28, added 4 - but net +3 since one was renamed)
  - Total backend tests: 153 passing
