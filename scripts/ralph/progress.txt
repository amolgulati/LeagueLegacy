# Fantasy League History Tracker - Ralph Progress Log (Improvements v2)
Started: 2026-01-07

## Codebase Patterns
- Backend: FastAPI with uvicorn at http://localhost:8000
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS at http://localhost:5173
- Database: SQLite with SQLAlchemy
- CORS configured to allow frontend dev server

## Key Files
- backend/app/main.py - FastAPI application entry point
- backend/app/api/routes.py - API route definitions
- backend/app/services/sleeper_client.py - Sleeper API client
- backend/app/services/sleeper_service.py - Sleeper import service
- frontend/src/App.tsx - Main React component
- frontend/src/index.css - Tailwind CSS imports

## Issues Being Addressed
1. Sleeper Import - Missing Historical Seasons (only imports current season)
2. Sleeper Import - No Champion Detection (playoff winner not recorded)
3. Sleeper Import - Player IDs Not Resolved (trades show numbers not names)
4. Yahoo Fantasy Import - Not fully implemented
5. UI/UX Gaps - Import modal needs loading states and error handling
