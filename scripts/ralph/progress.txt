# Fantasy League History Tracker - Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2025-01-07

## Codebase Patterns
- Backend: FastAPI with uvicorn at http://localhost:8000
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS at http://localhost:5173
- CORS configured to allow frontend dev server

## Key Files
- backend/app/main.py - FastAPI application entry point
- backend/app/api/routes.py - API route definitions
- frontend/src/App.tsx - Main React component
- frontend/src/index.css - Tailwind CSS imports

## 2025-01-07 - FLH-001
- What was implemented: Project structure initialization with FastAPI backend and React/Vite frontend
- Files changed:
  - Created backend/ folder with FastAPI app skeleton (main.py, routes.py, requirements.txt)
  - Created frontend/ folder with React/Vite/TypeScript/Tailwind CSS setup
  - Added README.md with project description and setup instructions
  - Added .gitignore files for both backend and frontend
- **Learnings:**
  - Tailwind CSS v3 needs explicit content paths in tailwind.config.js
  - CORS middleware is essential for frontend-backend communication during development
  - Both apps verified to start without errors (backend on 8000, frontend on 5173)
